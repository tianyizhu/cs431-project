     *
     *  Tune this controller only after successfully tuning the Y attitude
     *  (pitch) controller. Before that, set all gains of this controller to 0.
     *
     *  For this controller, all gains should be positive. If your system
     *  diverges with positive gains, make sure you have all sensor data
     *  in the standard body reference frame, and you have subtracted the
     *  state with reference (Y - R), not the other way around, in the PID
     *  controller control function.
     *
     *  To tune this controller, start by increasing the differential gain
     *  first. After the controller is able to resist some velocity change
     *  (damping), then increase the proportional gain until Biped is able
     *  to track the X position reference and no longer run off when pushed
     *  along the X axis (X position control)
     *
     *  It is required to use the Biped ground station to perform iterative
     *  tuning of the controller gains. Refer to the README for this lab for
     *  detailed instructions. Once you have obtained a satisfactory set of
     *  gain values using the Biped ground station, set those gain values in
     *  this constructor so that they are compiled into the firmware.
     *
     *  However, if you were unable to get the Biped ground station to function
     *  or work reliably, with the TA's approval, perform the controller tuning
     *  by directly changing the gain values in this constructor, and re-compile
     *  and re-flash the firmware every time you modify the gain values.
     *
     *  After successfully tuning all other gains for all controllers, tune the
     *  integral gains using the Biped ground station to minimize any steady-state
     *  errors. With the Biped ground station, the steady-state errors can be
     *  easily observed using the controller response plots. Start by increasing
     *  the maximum integrated error. Then, increase the integral gain until the
     *  steady-state errors are minimized.
     *
     *  Imagine the integral control as a piggy bank. The maximum integrated error
     *  is the size of the piggy bank, and the integral gain is the speed at
     *  which you insert the coins into the piggy bank. The higher the maximum
     *  integrated error, the more dominant the integral control would become. The
     *  higher the integral gain, the faster the integrated error would reach the
     *  maximum integrated error, given a constant source of steady-state errors.
     *  However, consider what would happen if the integrated error becomes too
     *  big (this is also why PI controllers can be dangerous in certain cases).
     *  The integral gain tuning is optional if controller tuning was performed
     *  without using the Biped ground station (with the TA's approval).

     *  disturbances (friction) if too slow. The bounds are also

     *  Therefore, it is important to stick with the same Biped
     *  throughout the remaining labs.
     *
     *  Why does the controller input need to be saturated? Image your
     *  Biped is current at 0 meter X position, and your reference is
