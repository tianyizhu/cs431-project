## Lab 1: Setup and I/O

In this lab, you will set up the Biped firmware project development environment and implement basic I/O operations in the Biped firmware.

Before getting started with this lab, first go through the entire project [README](../../../../../README.md), and then go through the entire [Eclipse Guide](../../biped-firmware/general/eclipse.md). Additionally, review the [Biped Guide](../../biped-firmware/general/biped.md) on how to properly handle and operate Biped.

### Objectives

1. Implement all Lab 1 todos in `main.cpp`.
2. Implement all Lab 1 todos in `task.cpp`.

Read carefully the comment blocks provided in the above header and source files for detailed steps and instructions. Search for `TODO LAB 1 YOUR CODE HERE` in the above header and source files to locate the todos.

### Demo (100 points)

1. (50 points) Demonstrate the correctness of all OLED display I/O operations. The Biped serial number, real-time task timings, heap utilization percentage, Wi-Fi status, controller status, and planner status should be printed to the OLED display on the correct lines.
2. (25 points) Demonstrate the correctness of all serial I/O operations. Upon boot, the Biped firmware initialization status should be printed to the serial terminal.
3. (25 points) Demonstrate the correctness of all NeoPixel I/O operations. The NeoPixel array should light up with the default color (blue).

If a lab group fails to complete the demo, partial credits will be given at the TA's discretion by examining the completeness and correctness of the lab group's codebase submitted to Canvas.
