## Lab 9: Application

It is time to have some fun and apply the codebase you have built! In this lab, you will create your own custom waypoint-based and maneuver-based plans in the Biped firmware. Your plans should instruct Biped to accomplish meaningful tasks, such as obstacle avoidance, object following, etc. Have fun, and be creative!

Note: the controller gains are specific to each individual Bipeds due to the subtle differences in their hardware construction, e.g., the center of gravity. Therefore, from this point on, pick a Biped and stick to the same one for the remaining labs. Notify the TA immediately regarding any loose components, as they may affect the control performance.

### Objectives

1. Implement all Lab 9 todos in `maneuver_planner.cpp`.
2. Implement all Lab 9 todos in `waypoint_planner.cpp`.

Read carefully the comment blocks provided in the above header and source files for detailed steps and instructions. Search for `TODO LAB 9 YOUR CODE HERE` in the above header and source files to locate the todos.

### Demo (100 points)

1. (50 points) Demonstrate your custom waypoint-based plans. Your plans should instruct Biped to accomplish meaningful tasks, such as obstacle avoidance, object following, etc.
2. (50 points) Demonstrate your custom maneuver-based plans. Your plans should instruct Biped to accomplish meaningful tasks, such as obstacle avoidance, object following, etc.

If a lab group fails to complete the demo, partial credits will be given at the TA's discretion by examining the completeness and correctness of the lab group's codebase submitted to Canvas.
